- **2)**
W(n) = 2W(n-1) + n
O(2^n)
- **3)**
S(n) = W(n-1) + n
S(n)
- **4)**
The counts list interesting patter is that the fibonnacci sequence starts to fill in from the back rather then the front. 
- **6)**
The maximum amount of times the fibtop down function can be called is 2n. This is because everytime you have an unkown value for N you call the recursive function twice.
The work of this algorithim is O(n) and the span is O(logn)
- **8)**
The maximum number of times $F_i$ will be 2n+1 for everytime an unknown value is presented it reads to values back and the plus references the final return. This means the work is O(n) and the span O(n).
